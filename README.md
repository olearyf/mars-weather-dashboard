## Welcome to the Mars Weather Dashboard!
### MAY 2021 UPDATE
Due to an update in the privacy settings of Chrome, the website is no longer visible as the API call fails and the error
`Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'.` is thrown. This causes the data to not load. This problem will be resolved soon!
## About
